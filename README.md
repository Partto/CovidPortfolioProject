# COVID-19 Data Exploration (SQL Project)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze COVID-19 global data using SQL.
The analysis highlights patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccinations to:
â€¢	Understand infection and mortality trends
â€¢	Compare COVID-19 impact across countries and continents
â€¢	Track vaccination progress over time
â€¢	Prepare cleaned, structured outputs for visualization and reporting

## Dataset
This project uses two datasets:
â€¢	CovidDeaths â€“ case counts, deaths, and population data
â€¢	CovidVaccinations â€“ vaccination rollout data

## Questions (KPIs)
The queries were designed to answer the following key questions:
â€¢	What is the likelihood of dying if infected with COVID-19?
â€¢	What percentage of each countryâ€™s population has been infected?
â€¢	Which countries have the highest infection rate compared to population?
â€¢	Which countries and continents have the highest death counts?
â€¢	What are the global totals for cases, deaths, and death percentage?
â€¢	How does vaccination progress compare against total population?

## Process
â€¢	Data Inspection: Queried raw COVID-19 data to check completeness and structure
â€¢	Case Analysis: Compared total cases vs deaths to calculate death percentages
â€¢	Population Analysis: Measured infection rates relative to population size
â€¢	Aggregations: Grouped data by country and continent for comparisons
â€¢	Global Metrics: Calculated worldwide totals for cases, deaths, and mortality rate
â€¢	Vaccination Tracking:
o	Used joins between CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations
o	Created rolling vaccination totals with SUM() OVER()
o	Implemented CTEs and Temp Tables to calculate percent vaccinated per population
â€¢	Data Preparation: Built a VIEW (PercentPopulationVaccinated) to store vaccination data for dashboards

## Project Insights
â€¢	The likelihood of dying from COVID-19 varies greatly by country and time period
â€¢	Certain countries had much higher infection rates relative to population
â€¢	The United States, India, and Brazil recorded the highest death counts globally
â€¢	At the continental level, Europe and North America show the highest cumulative death counts
â€¢	Vaccination progress can be tracked effectively using rolling totals, with clear differences across regions
â€¢	A significant gap exists between infection rates and vaccination coverage in some countries

## Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used not just for cleaning, but also for exploratory analysis of large-scale health data.
It provides:
â€¢	Clear insights into infection, death, and vaccination trends
â€¢	Aggregated metrics for country, continent, and global levels
â€¢	A reusable VIEW to connect with visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau) for deeper insights

## Tools & Technologies
â€¢	SQL Server â€“ Data exploration and analysis
â€¢	T-SQL Functions â€“ SUM() OVER(), CAST, NULLIF
â€¢	Common Table Expressions (CTEs) â€“ For population vs vaccination analysis
â€¢	Temp Tables â€“ To store intermediate results
â€¢	Views â€“ For persistent storage and visualization readiness
